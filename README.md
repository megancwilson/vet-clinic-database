Fot my databases class I created a vet clinic database using php, html, and css to record the vets, the animals, 
and the when the appointment was scheduled. I used phpmyadmin where I was able to use MySql to input my data and XAMPP
that uses apache to host my webserver. 



This project helped me enhance my knowledge with HTML, CSS, and I learned php which I was unfamiliar with but it was quite easy to learn to use.
